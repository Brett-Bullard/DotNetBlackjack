# DotNetBlackjack
Blackjack simulator
This is a project I did to see how long it would take players to go bankrupt playing blackjack by doubling their bets after every loss.
This project still needs a lot of cleanup and is just the initial coding I did.  I would really like to go back and add in some tests, along with a few more comments to get this going along with adding a dockerfile.
